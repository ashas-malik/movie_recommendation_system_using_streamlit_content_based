# movie_recommendation_system_using_streamlit_content_based

This is a movie recommender system that uses a dataset of 5000 movies and based on the cosine similarity approach it would give you 5 most similar movies on prompted with entering one movie. I have used streamlit for the front end of the web app . A lot of data preprocessing on the data has been performed and data cleaning as well.
